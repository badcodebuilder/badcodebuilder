# A little about BadCodeBuilder

C/Python player, noob for front-end, no UI skill, sandbox-game lover, postgraduate for CS

+ I'm currently working on [SDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking). Is that practical in reality? 😕
+ I'm playing [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net), and interested in red stone but it is so exhausting. 😴 I also play other sandbox games such as Factorio🏭, Mindustry🏗, Kerbal Space Plan🚀 ...
